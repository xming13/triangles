#Triangles

##About
This is a jquery plugin that generates triangles pixel-like svg images.

Check out [Demo](http://xming13.github.io/triangles/demo.html) for colours and love!

##Inspiration
I came across [michelle/triangles](https://github.com/michelle/triangles) on Github (which comes with [an inspiring story](http://blog.michellebu.com/2013/03/21-nested-callbacks/)) and thought it was really cool!

I played with it and decided to made it into a jquery plugin. Initially I mimic the original implementation and generate divs to make the triangles before I switch to svg instead for better pixel precision.

##Limitation
Admittedly this is the first time I make a jquery plugin and it isn't perfect.

Also, there is performance issue when there are too many triangles generated.

Any feedback and suggestion for improvement are welcomed. :)
